# 3GPP UE Address Service

## Overview

This service enables address resolution for User Equipment as per [3GPP TS 29.522](https://github.com/jdegre/5GC_APIs/blob/Rel-18/TS29522_UEAddress.yaml). It allows external systems to map identifiers to UE address data securely and efficiently.

## API Specification

Reference OpenAPI document:
[TS 29.522 UE Address - OpenAPI Definition](https://github.com/jdegre/5GC_APIs/blob/Rel-18/TS29522_UEAddress.yaml)

## Dependencies

- ue-identity service to translate an externalId into a supi
- redis to collect and publish core network events
- core-network-service as an adaptation layer between the core network and redis
- ue-profile service to consume consolidated real-time UE information from redis
- open-exposure libcapif library to interact with the open-exposure capif-service

## Configuration
Sample configuration:

```yaml
nbi:
  httpVersion: 1
  useTLS: no
  fqdn: 3gpp-ue-address
  port: 8888

sbi:
  identitySvc: http:/ue-identity-service:8080
  profileSvc: http://ue-profile-svc:8080
  httpVersion: 1

supportedFeatures: 3fff
capifSvc: http://capif-service:8080

```

## CAPIF Integration

- Uses `libcapif` library for communicating with capif service
- It register its own API to the Capif Core Function via the open-exposure capif service
- It supports logging and auditing functions via the libcapif integration
- It uses JWT token generated by the CAPIF Core Function to authorize API Invokers
- More info on the [capif-service](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/open-exposure/nef/capif-service) gitlab repository

## Run Locally
