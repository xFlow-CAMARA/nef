// UeIdInfo - Represents UE ID information.
type UeIdInfo struct {

	// string containing a local identifier followed by \"@\" and a domain identifier. Both the local identifier and the domain identifier shall be encoded as strings that do not contain any \"@\" characters. See Clause 4.6.2 of 3GPP TS 23.682 for more information.
	ExternalId string `json:"externalId"`

	// A string used to indicate the features supported by an API that is used as defined in clause  6.6 in 3GPP TS 29.500. The string shall contain a bitmask indicating supported features in  hexadecimal representation Each character in the string shall take a value of \"0\" to \"9\",  \"a\" to \"f\" or \"A\" to \"F\" and shall represent the support of 4 features as described in  table 5.2.2-3. The most significant character representing the highest-numbered features shall  appear first in the string, and the character representing features 1 to 4 shall appear last  in the string. The list of features and their numbering (starting with 1) are defined  separately for each API. If the string contains a lower number of characters than there are  defined features for an API, all features that would be represented by characters that are not  present in the string are not supported.
